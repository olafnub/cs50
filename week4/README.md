# Week 5 - Memory

## Definition
Every character value is in a memory. Variables point to the character's address to recieve it's calling.

## Example
Memory Character Storage: char *s = "hi"; "hi" is then stored and s looks for the memory "hi" and gives it it's own value of that. char *t = s; t looks for the address of "hi", therefore both s & t look for "hi". If t changes "hi" then s is affected as well
